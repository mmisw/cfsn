cfsn
====

A CF Standard Names Vocabulary browser -- prototype

Deployment available at http://mmisw.org/cfsn

See the [wiki](https://github.com/mmisw/cfsn/wiki) for documentation.


### Trying cfsn locally:

Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/mmisw/cfsn.git` and then open
`app/index.html` in your browser. To avoid potential issues caused by some
browsers when opening a regular local file, you can make the `app/`
subdirectory accessible from your web server. Alternatively, if you have
[nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) installed, you can simply run:
```
$ node scripts/web-server.js
```
and then open http://localhost:8000/app/index.html
